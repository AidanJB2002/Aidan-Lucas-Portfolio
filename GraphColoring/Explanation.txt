This project starts with an undirected, unweighted matrix with a set number of vertices. There are “m” possible colors that each 
vertex can be, and ones that are connected via an edge cannot be assigned the same color. We want to find the number of possible 
combinations of colors that can be assigned to each vertex while meeting these conditions. With the given matrix, m = 4, and the 
number of vertices is 12. The number of solutions is 67,128.
